## What is Debugging?
Debugging is the process of finding bugs in your apps and removing them. A bug can be considered anythin from a simple semicolon error to a whole logic mistake


### Why do you need to learn debugging
It is a known fact that every developer spends more time figuring out things why aren't working in the code rather than developing.
If you learn the art of debugging, you will be able to considerably reduce your time spent on fixing things and everyone will be happy.


## Lets Start

Go Ahead and download the basic project i have setup for you which we will follow along from the [github](https://github.com/Shubhank101/iOSAndroidChaosOverFlow-Projects) repository.  
Its developed in Xcode 7.3 and swift 2, so make sure to have them ready.

The folder contains both the app to be debugged and the working example for you to go through. 
Its a really simple 2 View Controllers code. The first calls the itunes search api to find list of games with keyword fifa and the next view controller just loads the game image.
