### Rules for our chat room
1) Be nice to everyone.

2) Use english for conversation only. Use of other languages can lead to banning you from the room.

3) Don't be a help vampire.

4) Use <a href="http://gist.github.com"> Gist </a> to share code in the chat.

5) Don't ping multiple people for help. Its considered rude, if someone is free he/she will help.
